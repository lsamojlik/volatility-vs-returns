Problem Description:

• The aim of the study is to compare the most and least volatile S&P 500 stocks over the period 2005–2024, in order to determine whether “riskier” stocks provide statistically higher returns.

• A stock's volatility simply measures how often and how much its price changes — regardless of whether it rises or falls. In this analysis, we calculate the sum of daily percentage changes — specifically, the absolute values of daily gains and losses within a given year (calculated as the difference between the close price on the current day and the previous day). This allows us to identify stocks that were unusually volatile, even if their year-end price did not change significantly.

• Returns were compared for the 50 most and 50 least volatile stocks each year (2005–2024) using two strategies: a lump-sum investment at the beginning of the year, and a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach with equal monthly contributions. This resulted in 1,000 observations for the most volatile stocks and 1,000 observations for the least volatile stocks over the last 20 years.

• In a further stage of the analysis, the 20 most volatile and 20 least volatile S&P 500 stocks over the last 10 years were compared over longer investment horizons (2, 3, 5, and 10 years).

Summary

Stable stocks statistically outperform — both in the short and long term. Median returns were generally higher for low-volatility stocks, with noticeably lower risk (measured by standard deviation). Over a long period (e.g., 10 years), the least volatile stocks delivered the best results: all achieved positive returns, while 8 of the 20 most volatile stocks incurred losses.

Volatility is both an opportunity and a risk. Investing in highly volatile stocks can yield spectacular gains, but can also result in painful losses. Volatility can be an investor’s ally if they are aware of the risks, have a clear plan, and maintain a long-term investment horizon.

DCA mitigates the effects of volatility, but even it does not make volatile stocks inherently attractive in the short term. Volatility remains a factor that, although spread over time, still carries a high risk of disappointment.

Selectivity is key. Only a few volatile stocks — such as NVIDIA or AMD — have delivered above-average returns in recent years. High volatility alone is not a sufficient investment argument. Understanding a company’s fundamentals, its position in the business cycle, and market factors affecting its price behavior is far more important.

Therefore, the hypothesis that volatility is automatically rewarded with higher returns can be rejected — persistence alone is not enough for success. Data from the last 20 years show that selectivity and rational analysis matter more than mere patience. Buying stocks after large drops simply because they are volatile, without understanding their fundamentals, often results in losses.

For most investors, especially those with limited risk tolerance, the best strategy remains exposure to stable, defensive companies with predictable cash flows — or investing through index funds. The key is not chasing volatility, but being selective and understanding why a stock behaves in a certain way.
